# Odin Recipe

This project's part of The Odin Project, and it's all about creating a simple recipe page using basic HTML. I'll be demonstrating my skills in structuring a webpage, using headings, lists, and links effectively. By the time I'm done, I'll have a clear understanding of how to present content in a clean and organized manner. It's a great way to practice what I've learned so far!
