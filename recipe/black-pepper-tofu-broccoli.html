          <li>1 head broccoli, separated into florets</li>
          <li>3 tablespoons sesame oil</li>
          <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Slice tofu into thirds lengthwise so you have 3 even slabs. Stack
            the slabs on top of each other and slice through them lengthwise to
            make 3 even columns, then slice across to make 5 even rows.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lay tofu evenly on a plate lined with a couple layers of paper
            towels. Layer more paper towels on top of the tofu and place another
            plate on top of the stack. Press out as much water as possible and
            let sit for at least 30 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking
            sheet with parchment paper.
          </li>
          <li>
            Transfer pressed tofu and broccoli into a mixing bowl. Drizzle with
            sesame oil and soy sauce; toss lightly to combine. Mix cornstarch,
            garlic powder, ground ginger, and black pepper together in a small
            bowl; sprinkle over tofu and broccoli. Toss until evenly coated, and
            arrange in one layer on the prepared baking sheet.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Flip and continue baking
            until crispy, about 10 minutes more. Serve warm.
